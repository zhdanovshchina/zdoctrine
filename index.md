title: The Zhdanov Doctrine
---
  Welcome to *The Zhdanov Doctrine*, the very first English-language anti-revisionist Marxist Leninist music blog! 

  *The Zhdanov Doctrine* is produced by artistic workers and communists present in the working class and oppressed people's struggles. We analyze and critique everything through the Marxist worldview, free from revisionism or opportunism, and bring the ideology of the working class to the realm of music, in which we are all active as musicians, organizers, and music lovers.
