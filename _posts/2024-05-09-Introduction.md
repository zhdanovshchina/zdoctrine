Welcome to *The Zhdanov Doctrine*, the very first English-langugae anti-revisionist Marxist Leninist music blog (probably). Posts will consist of analyses, short biographies, and 
anything else we think is relevant to music lovers and musicians in the workers movement. This project is maintained and created by organizers and musicians.

This will be an ongoing collaborative project between myself (Sofia D.), and a few other comrades. We'll start with blog posts, and eventually 
scale up to podcasts and other multi-media projects. 

â€“ Sofia D.
